# Client Management System

## Overview

The Client Management System is a web application built with React that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on client data. Users can add new clients, update existing client details, delete clients, and view a list of all clients. The application uses a backend server for data storage and retrieval, and Axios for HTTP requests.

## Features

- **Add Client**: Input client details (name, email, mobile) and save them to the server.
- **Edit Client**: Update existing client details via a form pre-filled with current data.
- **Delete Client**: Remove a client from the system.
- **View Clients**: Display a list of all clients in a table format with options to edit or delete.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express (not provided but assumed for handling requests)
- **Database**: MongoDB (assumed for storing client data)
- **HTTP Client**: Axios

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm (>= 6.x)

### Frontend Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/client-management-system.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

bash
Copy code
cd client-management-system

3. **Install Dependencies**:

bash
Copy code
npm install

4. **Start the Development Server**:

bash
Copy code
npm start

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Backend Installation (Assumed)
If you have a backend setup, ensure it is running on http://localhost:8080 or modify the axios.defaults.baseURL in App.js to match your server's URL.

### Configuration
The application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following (if needed):

env
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

## Usage
Add a Client: Click the "Add" button to open the form, enter client details, and submit.
Edit a Client: Click the "Edit" button next to a client's entry in the table, update the details, and submit.
Delete a Client: Click the "Delete" button next to a client's entry.
View Clients: All clients are listed in a table format with options to edit or delete.
